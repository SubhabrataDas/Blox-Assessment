# Crypto Trading API

## Introduction
At Blox, we believe Bitcoin is a disruptive technology in the fintech domain that brings to people
more freedom when doing payments or making investments. You're in charge of your own money,
transactions are extremely fast (even outside ‘business hours’), and you can send any amount of
bitcoins to anyone in the world (without any difference in transaction costs). Bitcoin (and
blockchain) is the revolution in the finance world only comparable with the role of the Internet in
world global communications.

But it is not only bitcoins, there are many other cryptocurrencies in the market. You can also use
these cryptocurrencies as an investment. That's what many people do at the moment. The value of
bitcoin has grown tremendously over the last ten years. If you get it right, you can get a huge
return by trading in cryptocurrencies.

## Assignment
As a crypto trading company, most of our operations are related to trading cryptocurrencies. The
fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market are among the most important reasons a customer considers
when to buy or sell. The customer goal is to accumulate coins for their future appreciation or earn
profit on price fluctuations. Therefore, the information on market prices is an important part of
the information stream we provide to our customers.

We would like you to build an API that allows fictitious customers to buy and sell coins, providing
the necessary information they need to decide when to buy or sell the coins. This API should also
consider that the company also wants to make a profit from it (for example, a commission per
transaction).

As a stating point, this repository supports creating and retrieving a ledger for a user. 
The assignment is to implement buying and selling coins and update the ledger for given user. 

## Restrictions & Notes
- We will positively value the use of technologies from our stack. We also understand the learning
  curve associated with some these technologies, so feel free to choose an appropriate substitute
  when needed:
  - Spring Framework
  - Axon Framework
  - PostgreSQL
  - Docker
- We will positively value correct usage of general asynchronous and reactive programming practices
  and Event Sourcing design patterns.
- Writing tests (especially integration ones) are welcomed, feel free to balance yourself
  priorities between functionality and testing.
- Even if we value the completeness of the assessment, we understand this will be done in your own
  personal time, so we will take this into account in the evaluation.
- In case something is unclear, please feel free to forge your own assumptions. We are also
  interested in knowing what you consider crucial and how you prioritize your work.
- For simplicity, you can assume the API only operates with bitcoins.
- It is fine to use a random or hardcoded price for the coins. When time left you could use an external source for retrieving realtime market prices.
- Dependencies might be outdated, don't put your precious time in updating these. 
  This won't contribute to the goal of this assessment. 

## Goal
This assessment aims to get a sense of your development and communication style and the way you
present your ideas. Be creative and have fun. Do you want to show some technical tricks, neat
design patterns? Go for it. After reviewing your work on solving this challenge, we will invite you
to an open discussion with part of the development team and look together at the final result.

Aim to work around 4 to maximal 8 hours on the assessment. The goal is not have a full-fledged working application.
A part of application that works is fine as long as there is something to present and we can discuss.
